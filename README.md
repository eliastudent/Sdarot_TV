I created this project in the first year of my computer science degree.
The motivation for creating this project was when I wanted to watch a series on the website,
but the servers were busy, 
so I created an automatic bot by using Selenium ChromeDriver,
whose role is to wait in my place until a server becomes available and in the meantime I go to my other occupations,
if a server is not available it loads the website again and again Until a viewing server becomes available for me,
and when that happens the computer makes a sound that lets me know the video is ready to play.


Attached is a video for the description:
